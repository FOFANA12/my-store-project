MyStore is a single-page application that was created as part of my training. Purpose of this application is to enable order registration.

The application was made with Angular 15.0.4 and the features are:

- Product list page, which displays the available products for the user to choose and add to their cart (in various quantities);
- Product details page, which displays more information about any particular product;
- Shopping cart, which includes the products that the user has added to their cart;
- Checkout form, which collects information about the user (e.g., full name, address, credit card);
- Order confirmation page, which shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process.
